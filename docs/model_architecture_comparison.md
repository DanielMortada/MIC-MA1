## Model Architecture Comparison: Key Insights

Here's a table summarizing the key differences between the three models in a way that's easier to grasp:

| Feature                 | SimpleCNN                                     | ResNet-18                                         | EfficientNet-B0                                       |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overall Idea**        | A basic stack of Convolution -> Activation -> Pooling layers. Gets deeper by adding more layers. | Uses "skip connections" (shortcuts) to help information flow better in very deep networks. Prevents vanishing gradients. | Designed to be efficient by carefully balancing network depth, width (channels), and input image resolution. Uses special building blocks. |
| **Building Block**      | `Conv2d` -> `BatchNorm2d` -> `ReLU` -> `MaxPool2d` | **BasicBlock**: Two `Conv2d` layers with `BatchNorm2d` and `ReLU`. Crucially, adds the input of the block to its output (skip connection). | **MBConv (Mobile Inverted Bottleneck)**: A more complex block using depthwise separable convolutions, squeeze-and-excitation optimization, and skip connections. |
| **Depth**               | Relatively shallow (4 Conv layers shown).     | Deeper (18 layers with weights, hence the name). Skip connections allow for this depth. | Moderately deep, but designed for efficiency. Uses compound scaling to grow effectively. |
| **Feature Extraction**  | Standard convolutional feature hierarchy.     | Deeper hierarchy enabled by residual connections. Learns residual functions. | Efficient feature extraction using depthwise separable convolutions and channel attention (Squeeze-and-Excitation). |
| **Classifier**          | Flattens features, then uses `Linear` layers with `Dropout` for regularization. | Uses `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` to reduce feature map size, then a single `Linear` layer. Simpler classifier due to stronger features from the backbone. | Uses `AdaptiveAvgPool2d`, `Dropout`, and a single `Linear` layer. Similar to ResNet but often with fewer parameters in the classifier head. |
| **Key Innovation**      | Standard CNN approach.                        | **Residual Connections (Skip Connections)**: Allows training much deeper networks effectively. | **Compound Scaling & MBConv Blocks**: Optimizes accuracy and efficiency (FLOPS/parameters) simultaneously. |
| **Activation Function** | Primarily `ReLU`.                             | Primarily `ReLU`.                                 | Primarily `SiLU` (also known as Swish), often performs better than ReLU. |
| **Regularization**      | `BatchNorm2d`, `MaxPool2d`, `Dropout` in classifier. | `BatchNorm2d`, `MaxPool2d`. Implicit regularization from skip connections. | `BatchNorm2d`, `Dropout`, **Stochastic Depth** (randomly drops entire blocks during training). |
| **Complexity**          | Simplest.                                     | More complex than SimpleCNN due to skip connections and depth. | Most complex internal block structure, but highly optimized for efficiency. |

**In Simple Terms:**

*   **SimpleCNN:** Like building with basic LEGO bricks, stacking them higher.
*   **ResNet-18:** Like building with LEGOs but adding bridges (skip connections) between layers so signals don't get lost in tall structures.
*   **EfficientNet-B0:** Like using advanced, pre-fabricated LEGO Technic parts (MBConv) designed for specific functions and put together in a very resource-conscious way.
