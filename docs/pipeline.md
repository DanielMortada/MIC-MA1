## 1. **Preliminary Analysis**

### **Key Questions: (Easy)**

- **Data Input & Output**  
  - *What is the input shape of my images?*  
    (e.g., 3×224×224)  
  - *How many output classes do I need?*  
    (30 classes for instruments)

### **Actions:**

- Verify and document your dataset’s dimensions.
- Establish the first and final layers accordingly.

## 2. **Baseline Architecture Design**

### **Key Questions: (Easy)**

- **Basic Blocks & Structure**  
  - *How many convolutional blocks do I need?*  
    (Decide on an initial structure, e.g., 3–5 blocks to gradually reduce spatial dimensions)
  - *What common components should each block contain?*  
    (e.g., Conv → BatchNorm → ReLU → Pooling)
- **Initial Capacity**  
  - *How many parameters are appropriate given 4800 training images?*  
    (Aim for a moderate complexity to avoid overfitting)

### **Actions:**

- Sketch out a simple architecture blueprint:
  - **Block 1:** Input layer, a couple of convolutional layers (e.g., 32 filters), pooling, dropout  
  - **Block 2+:** Progressive increases in filters (e.g., 32→64→128→…) with similar components
- Establish a classifier head (global average pooling or flattening, followed by dense layers) that outputs a 30-dimensional vector.

## 3. **Overfitting Mitigation and Regularization**

### **Key Questions: (Easy)**

- **Regularization Methods**  
  - *What techniques will I employ to prevent overfitting?*  
    (Incorporate dropout, batch normalization, and possibly early stopping)
- **Placement & Rates**  
  - *Where should dropout and normalization be placed, and at what rates?*  
    (Decide on dropout rates per block: e.g., 0.1 in initial layers, increasing gradually)

### **Actions:**

- Integrate dropout layers and batch normalization after convolutional layers.
- Set initial dropout rates and adjust them based on subsequent validation performance.

## 4. **Detailed Architectural Refinements**

### **Key Questions: (Hard)**

- **Depth and Complexity**  
  - *What is the optimal number of convolution blocks?*  
    (Experiment with 4 or 5 blocks; consider the trade-off between feature extraction and overfitting)
- **Filter Progression**  
  - *How should filter counts evolve?*  
    (Commonly, double the filters after each pooling, e.g., 32→64→128→256)
- **Classifier Design**  
  - *How should the high-dimensional features be aggregated?*  
    (Global average pooling vs. flattening plus fully connected layers; decide based on performance)
- **Activation Functions**  
  - *Is ReLU sufficient or should I try alternatives like LeakyReLU?*

### **Actions:**

- Adjust your architecture to include more sophisticated design elements:
  - Experiment with additional layers or altered filter progression.
  - Compare different classifier heads (global pooling vs. multiple dense layers).
  - Optionally implement and test residual connections if deeper networks are built.

## 5. **Training Strategy & Hyperparameters**

### **Key  Questions: (Hard)**

- **Loss Function & Optimizer**  
  - *Which loss function best suits a multi-class problem?*  
    (Cross-Entropy Loss is standard)  
  - *Which optimizer and learning rate should I start with?*  
    (Start with Adam at 0.001)
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**  
  - *Should I use a learning rate scheduler to adapt during training?*  
    (Implement schedulers like ReduceLROnPlateau for adaptive behavior)
- **Epochs and Batch Size**  
  - *What’s the right batch size and number of epochs?*  
    (Batch size 32; epochs 20–30 to start, with early stopping if needed)

### **Actions:**

- Choose initial values for hyperparameters.
- Define a training loop (or adapt one) that integrates:
  - Forward and backward passes,
  - Optimizer steps per batch,
  - Scheduler adjustments per epoch or batch.
- Set up early stopping based on validation performance.

## 6. **Evaluation and Iterative Refinement**

### **Key Questions: (Hard)**

- **Performance Metrics**  
  - *What metrics will I use to evaluate model performance?*  
    (Accuracy, confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1 scores)
- **Analysis Framework**  
  - *How will I compare design alternatives?*  
    (Establish experiments for varying depth, dropout rates, optimizers, etc.)
- **Advanced Techniques**  
  - *Can incorporating architectural innovations (residual connections, depthwise separable convolutions) yield improvements?*

### **Actions:**

- Develop a robust validation pipeline.
- Visualize training/validation curves and analyze errors.
- Iterate over the model design by tweaking the architecture based on evaluation results.
- Document each experiment’s configuration and outcomes.
