    "### Understanding the Data Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "The data transformations applied to our musical instrument images serve several critical purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Size Standardization** (`transforms.Resize((224, 224))`)\n",
    "   - **Why needed**: Neural networks require consistent input dimensions. Images in our dataset may have different original sizes and aspect ratios.\n",
    "   - **Why 224x224**: This is the standard input size for ResNet-18 and many other pre-trained CNN architectures. Since we're using transfer learning, matching the input size that the network was originally trained with is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Augmentation** (applied only to training data)\n",
    "   - **RandomHorizontalFlip**: Musical instruments generally maintain their identity when flipped horizontally\n",
    "   - **RandomRotation(15)**: Adds robustness to slight orientation variations in the images\n",
    "   - **ColorJitter**: Helps the model become invariant to lighting conditions and color variations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalization** (`transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])`)\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Standardizes the pixel values to have similar ranges, which helps with training stability and convergence\n",
    "   - **Values**: These specific values represent the mean and standard deviation of the RGB channels in the ImageNet dataset, which our pre-trained ResNet-18 was trained on\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Different Transforms for Training vs. Validation/Test**:\n",
    "   - Training data receives data augmentation to artificially expand the dataset and improve generalization\n",
    "   - Validation and test data only receive resizing and normalization to evaluate the model on clean, unmodified images\n",
    "\n",
    "These transformations are essential for achieving good performance with transfer learning and help our model generalize better to unseen images of musical instruments."

    "### Why ResNet-18 is an Excellent Baseline Model Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "ResNet-18 is a well-justified choice for our baseline model for several compelling reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Balanced Complexity**\n",
    "   - With 11.7 million parameters, ResNet-18 offers substantial representational capacity while still being lightweight enough for academic projects\n",
    "   - Trains efficiently even on limited GPU resources (like those provided for free by Google Colab)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strong Architecture Design**\n",
    "   - Features residual connections that address the vanishing gradient problem\n",
    "   - Deep enough to capture complex features in musical instruments (texture, shape, structure)\n",
    "   - Proven performance on a wide range of image classification tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transfer Learning Benefits**\n",
    "   - Pre-trained on over 1 million ImageNet images across 1,000 classes\n",
    "   - Lower layers already capture universal visual features (edges, textures, patterns)\n",
    "   - Requires less data to fine-tune for our specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Considerations**\n",
    "   - Well-documented with extensive examples in PyTorch\n",
    "   - Has excellent convergence properties during training\n",
    "   - Robust to hyperparameter choices, making it more forgiving for initial experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Benchmark Status**\n",
    "   - Continues to be a standard benchmark in computer vision literature\n",
    "   - Provides a meaningful baseline against which to compare custom architectures"

    "2. **Fine-tuning phase**: Carefully unfreezing deeper convolutional layers (layer4) to optimize feature extraction\n",
