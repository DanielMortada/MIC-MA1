\section{Introduction}
Musical instrument classification from images represents a challenging computer vision task with numerous applications in music education, content-based image retrieval, and multimedia systems. Identifying instruments from visual information alone requires models that can recognize distinctive shapes, textures, and subtle details that differentiate various instrument classes. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have revolutionized computer vision tasks by enabling automatic feature extraction and hierarchical pattern recognition \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, simonyan2014very}.

This paper presents a systematic three-phase approach to musical instrument classification using deep learning techniques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1:} Comparison of transfer learning with ResNet-18 (99.33\% accuracy) against a custom CNN architecture developed from scratch (80.67\% accuracy)
    \item \textbf{Phase 2:} Systematic comparison of multiple custom CNN architectures, identifying the Deeper CNN as the best-performing custom model (86.67\% accuracy)
    \item \textbf{Phase 3:} Optimization of the Deeper CNN through selective attention mechanisms, residual connections, graduated dropout, class-specific augmentation, and mixed precision training (93.33\% accuracy)
\end{itemize}

The primary objective is to develop robust models capable of accurately identifying 30 different musical instrument classes from images while understanding the tradeoffs involved in different architectural and training decisions. Throughout this research, we have completed all three phases, providing comprehensive insights into the development, comparison, and optimization of CNN models for musical instrument classification.

The significance of this work lies in its thorough exploration of model architecture design, training strategies, and performance optimization techniques. By comparing transfer learning approaches with custom architectures, we provide insights into when pre-trained models are beneficial and when custom solutions may be more appropriate for specialized classification tasks. Additionally, our analysis of the feature extraction process helps illuminate how CNNs learn to distinguish between visually similar musical instruments.

Our contributions include: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of ResNet-18 as a transfer learning baseline for musical instrument classification; (2) the systematic comparison of multiple custom CNN architectures, demonstrating that depth is more valuable than width for this classification task; (3) the development of an optimized Deeper CNN with selective attention mechanisms and graduated dropout that achieves 93.33\% test accuracy, closing the gap with the transfer learning approach to just 6.00\%; (4) empirical evidence on the effectiveness of class-specific augmentation for challenging instrument categories; and (5) visualization techniques that enhance model interpretability and reveal how architectural optimizations improve feature localization.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the dataset, preprocessing steps, and experimental setup. Section III details our methodology, including the baseline ResNet-18 model, our custom CNN architectures, and the optimization strategies applied to the Deeper CNN model. Section IV presents comprehensive experimental results from all three phases, including detailed analysis of architectural variants, optimization techniques, and class-specific performance. Section V concludes with a discussion of our findings and their implications for the field of deep learning-based image classification.
