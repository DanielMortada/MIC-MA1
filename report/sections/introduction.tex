\section{Introduction}
The classification of musical instruments from images represents a significant challenge within computer vision, yet holds considerable potential for applications spanning music education, content-based retrieval, and multimedia systems. Visually distinguishing instruments necessitates models capable of discerning subtle variations in shape, texture, and detail. Fortunately, advancements in deep learning, particularly the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, simonyan2014very}, have substantially advanced such tasks through automatic feature extraction and hierarchical pattern recognition.

This paper details a systematic three-phase investigation into CNN-based musical instrument classification. The phases were structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1:} Initially, we compared transfer learning using ResNet-18 (achieving 99.33\% accuracy) against a custom CNN architecture developed from scratch (yielding 80.67\% accuracy).
    \item \textbf{Phase 2:} Subsequently, we systematically evaluated multiple custom CNN architectures, which led to the identification of a Deeper CNN as the most promising configuration (attaining 86.67\% accuracy).
    \item \textbf{Phase 3:} Finally, we focused on optimizing this Deeper CNN through a combination of selective attention mechanisms, residual connections, graduated dropout, class-specific augmentation, and mixed precision training, ultimately achieving 93.33\% accuracy.
\end{itemize}

Our primary objective throughout this research was the development of robust models capable of accurately identifying 30 distinct instrument classes, while concurrently gaining a deeper understanding of the inherent tradeoffs in architectural and training decisions. This completed research, therefore, offers comprehensive insights into the development, comparison, and optimization process pertinent to this classification task.

The significance of this work lies in its thorough exploration of model design, training strategies, and performance optimization. By contrasting transfer learning approaches with custom-built architectures, we provide valuable insights into scenarios where pre-trained models excel versus those where bespoke solutions might be more appropriate for specialized classification tasks. Furthermore, our analysis illuminates the mechanisms by which CNNs learn to differentiate between visually similar instruments.

Our principal contributions include: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of ResNet-18 as a transfer learning baseline for this task; (2) the systematic comparison of multiple custom CNNs, demonstrating the advantage of depth over width for musical instrument classification; (3) the development of an optimized Deeper CNN (93.33\% accuracy) incorporating selective attention and graduated dropout, thereby narrowing the performance gap with the transfer learning approach to 6.00\%; (4) empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of class-specific augmentation for challenging instrument categories; and (5) the application of visualization techniques to enhance model interpretability and reveal how specific optimizations improve feature localization.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section II describes the dataset, preprocessing methods, and experimental setup. Section III elaborates on the methodology, covering the baseline model, custom architectures, and optimization strategies. Section IV presents the empirical results from all three phases, including analyses of architectural variants, optimization techniques, and class-specific performance. Finally, Section V concludes with a discussion of the findings and considers their broader implications for deep learning-based image classification.
