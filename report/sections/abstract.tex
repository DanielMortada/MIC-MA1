\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a systematic three-phase approach to musical instrument classification using deep learning techniques. We develop and evaluate convolutional neural network (CNN) models capable of identifying 30 distinct musical instrument classes from images. In Phase 1, we compare a transfer learning approach using ResNet-18 (achieving 100\% test accuracy) with a custom CNN architecture developed from scratch (achieving 80.67\% accuracy). Phase 2, which is ongoing, employs a flexible experimental framework to systematically compare multiple CNN architectures, including deeper, wider, and more regularized variants. Phase 3, planned as future work, will focus on optimizing the most promising architecture identified in Phase 2. Our contribution includes a comprehensive evaluation of the tradeoffs between transfer learning and custom architectures, a flexible framework for architecture comparison, and insights into how CNNs learn to distinguish between visually similar musical instruments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning for specialized image classification tasks while highlighting the importance of systematic architecture exploration and optimization.
