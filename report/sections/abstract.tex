\begin{abstract}
We present a three-phase study of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying 30 musical instrument classes from images. Phase~1 establishes a ResNet-18 transfer learning baseline (99.33\% test accuracy) and compares it to a custom CNN trained from scratch (80.67\%). Phase~2 uses a uniform framework to evaluate custom variants - deeper, wider, and regularized - identifying the Deeper CNN as the best performer (86.67\%). Phase~3 applies a two-stage optimization: an initial attempt that regressed to 81.00\%, followed by a refined strategy with class-specific augmentation, selective attention, balanced regularization, and mixed precision training, culminating in 93.33\% accuracy. Our results quantify trade-offs between transfer learning and bespoke designs, reveal common optimization pitfalls, and demonstrate how failure-driven refinement can close the performance gap in specialized image classification tasks.
