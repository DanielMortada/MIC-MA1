\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a systematic three-phase investigation into the application of deep learning for musical instrument classification. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models were developed and evaluated for their ability to identify 30 distinct instrument classes from images. Initially, Phase 1 compared a ResNet-18 transfer learning baseline, which achieved 99.33\% test accuracy, against a custom CNN built from scratch, yielding 80.67\% accuracy. Subsequently, Phase 2 employed a flexible framework to systematically compare various custom CNN architectures—including deeper, wider, and regularized variants—ultimately identifying the Deeper CNN as the most effective custom configuration with 86.67\% accuracy. Finally, Phase 3 focused on optimizing this Deeper CNN through targeted strategies, incorporating class-specific data augmentation, selective attention mechanisms, residual connections, graduated dropout, and mixed precision training. Consequently, the optimized model attained 93.33\% test accuracy, significantly narrowing the performance gap relative to the transfer learning baseline. Key contributions encompass a thorough evaluation of the tradeoffs between transfer learning and bespoke architectures, empirical insights into the relative importance of different architectural components, and the demonstration of effective optimization strategies. Our findings indicate that methodical architectural refinement coupled with targeted training optimization can substantially elevate the performance of custom models within specialized image classification domains.
